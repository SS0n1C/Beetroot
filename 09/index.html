                    React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and
                    the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs
                    APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: <span
                        class="italic">bundles
                        of reusable, nestable code</span>. You can learn more about React in the next section. But
                    first, let‚Äôs
                    cover how components work in React Native.

                    React Native runs on <span class="underline">React</span>, a popular open source library for
                    building user interfaces with
                    JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can
                    get you started or can serve as a refresher course.

                    <span class="weight">+ components.</span> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its
                    examples: friendly,
                    approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.

                <div class="section_txt">
                    <span class="weight">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write
                    elements inside JavaScript like
                    so: <span class="back">&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;.</span>
                </div>
                <div class="section_txt">
                    The React docs have <span class="underline">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you can refer to
                    learn even more. Because JSX is
                    JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span class="back"> name
                    </span> for the cat, name, and
                    embedding it with curly braces inside <span class="back">&lt;Text&gt;</span>

                <div class="section_txt">
                    <span class="weight">+ props.</span> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.

                <div class="section_txt">
                    <span class="weight"> + state.</span> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure
                    how components render, state
                    is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over
                    time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!

                    TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <span class="italic"> onChangeText</span> prop that
                    takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a
                    function to be called when the text is submitted.

                <div class="section_txt">
                    For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different
                    language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence
                    "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
